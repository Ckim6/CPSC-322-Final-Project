# CPSC-322-Final-Project

This project is called "I'm Going to Disney World!", which is a data analysis project on football data. Specifically, using the offensive and defensive ranks in points and yards to predict whether a team will make the playoffs or miss the playoffs. 

In order to run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this GitHub repository
2. Open the TechnicalReport.ipynb file
3. Run all of the cells in the TechnicalReport.ipynb file
From there, you should be able to see all of the visualizations and classifiers that were used in this project, as well as, all of the results.

The project is set up with three different directories and a few different files. The input_data directory is where all of the raw .xls files that were downloaded from https://www.sports-reference.com/ are stored. The input_data_csv directory is where all of the raw .xls data files that were converted into .csv files are stored. The mysklearn directory has all of the different classes, classifiers, and utility functions used in this project. The input_data_cleaned.csv is the final output file for our cleaned data. The test_myclassifiers.py file has all of the tests for our classifiers. The projectProposal.ipynb file is our initial plan for this project. The TechnicalReport.ipynb file is our finished product with all of our work and findings in it.
